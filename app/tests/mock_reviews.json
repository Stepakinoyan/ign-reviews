        "text": "As a longtime fan of the series, 2020\u2019s Yakuza: Like a Dragon came as a bit of a shock to my system. Fun as it was, the sudden switch to stop-start, turn-based JRPG attacks was a lot to get my head around after more than a decade of enjoying the series\u2019 signature combo-based beat \u2018em up action \u2013 a bit like spending over 10 years getting really good at thumb wrestling and then being asked to play chess. Thankfully its follow-up, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, substantially retools the combat system: it\u2019s still turn-based, but the tactical decision-making introduced by its predecessor is enhanced with more flexible movement and proximity-based attacks that better reflect the rough-and-tumble tactility of the traditional Yakuza street fights. As a result, Infinite Wealth\u2019s brawling feels more like the best of both worlds, and its stunning new Hawaiian setting provides the perfect playground in which to unleash its superior style of smackdown.\n\nFace-Off: What's the Best Yakuza Game? Pick a winner New duel 1ST 2ND 3RD See your Results Finish playing for your personal results or see the community\u2019s! Continue playingSee results\n\nMain hero Ichiban Kasuga returns from Yakuza: Like a Dragon and remains the loveable human labrador that he was before \u2013 unwaveringly upbeat no matter how often he\u2019s beaten down \u2013 and this time he\u2019s paired up with series stalwart Kazuma Kiryu, who we find in a more reflective mood due to his recent cancer diagnosis. This odd couple travels to Hawaii in search of the biological mother that Kasuga has never known; however they soon find themselves caught in a compelling conspiracy involving a local religious sect and multiple crime syndicates. The ensuing mystery quickly takes some dramatic twists and turns without ever becoming as tangled as some of the more convoluted plots of the series\u2019 past. Along the way a number of contemporary issues like environmental mismanagement and the spreading of online misinformation are explored, and all of those themes mixed together to give me more to chew on than a konbini bento box.\n\nThe core supporting cast from Yakuza: Like a Dragon are also along for the ride, joined by likable locals Eric Tomizawa and Chitose Fujinomiya, and there are some wonderful scene-stealing villains to encounter. That includes a mob boss played by a gruff-as-ever Danny Trejo, whose contract may or may not have stipulated that his character, Dwight Mendez, wields a pair of machetes. Despite the fact that some of the lengthier conversation cutscenes took longer to wrap up than a phone call from my parents, by and large I found the writing in Infinite Wealth to be some of the strongest in the series to date, whether it was during the heightened moments of serious drama or the many lowbrow bursts of comic relief. As was the case with the gang\u2019s previous adventure, I particularly enjoyed the idle banter between them as I roamed the streets \u2013 whether they were musing about the limited battery life of Sega\u2019s Game Gear handheld or debating the differences in taste between Japanese and Hawaiian soy sauce.\n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth Review Screens 24 Images\n\nMarking the first time that a Like a Dragon story has shifted beyond the shores of Japan, Infinite Wealth\u2019s Hawaii doesn\u2019t just feel like an invigorating new setting for the series, but for games in general. Typically the only games set in the exotic US island state involve operating battleships in World War II or steering sports cars around its coastline highways, so it's nice to play a game that allows you to slip on a pair of flip-flops and explore this fictionalised slice of paradise on foot \u2013 or on a zippy motorised Segway, if you really want to look like a tourist. I\u2019m sadly not nearly as familiar with the real Honolulu as I\u2019d like to be, but perhaps because of that I loved roaming around Infinite Wealth\u2019s surprisingly spacious setting, from its sandy shorelines to shiny shopping malls, grabbing local delicacies like shave ice to replenish my health and throwing a friendly \u201cAloha\u201d to everyone I passed with a tap of a button.\n\n\u201c You can take a Like a Dragon game out of Japan, [but] you can\u2019t take the heaving hordes of weirdo enemy types out of a Like a Dragon game.\n\nThat said, the Honolulu map \u2013 which is so vast you could apparently fit nine Kamurochos inside it \u2013 isn\u2019t the only location to explore in Infinite Wealth, and after spending the bulk of the story\u2019s first half helping Kasuga\u2019s search through the streets of Waikiki, Kiryu eventually returns to Japan to try and unravel the mystery from a different angle. As a result, for a handful of the campaign\u2019s 14 chapters (totaling around 50 hours) you get to explore both the Yokohama and Kamurocho maps from previous games in the series, each complete with a unique set of substories and side activities that see the gravely ill Kiryu reminisce about his many earlier adventures and make amends with some of the survivors he\u2019s left in his wake. The bulk of these bucket list tasks are optional, and if you\u2019re new to the series you might not get much out of them beyond the token experience points for ticking them off, but I enjoyed the opportunity to take a detour away from the streets of rage for a sentimental trip down memory lane.\n\nSurf and Turf Wars\n\nAlong the way it becomes clear that while you can take a Like a Dragon game out of Japan, you can\u2019t take the heaving hordes of weirdo enemy types out of a Like a Dragon game. Despite the fact that the bulk of Infinite Wealth takes place on US soil, I once again found myself indulging in regular battles against hundreds of hilariously off-kilter assailants with pun-based names like Hungry Hungry Homeless and Imp Patient, as though I was locked in an ongoing war with a gang of grown-up Garbage Pail Kids. However, this time around each freaky face-off feels far more lively and intuitive than the comparatively stilted scraps you get into during Yakuza: Like a Dragon, thanks to the added freedom to reposition each of your four team members within a set movement arc at the start of each turn.\n\nThis very clever change means you get to inflict bonus damage by moving your character to attack an enemy up close or from the rear, and you can also grab objects like bicycles and explosive barrels and crash them into crowds in order to share the suffering around. In Yakuza: Like a Dragon your team members would occasionally grab makeshift weapons automatically, but here you get to decide exactly which object to use, and there are a lot more to choose from with explosive gas canisters to pick up and throw and even rocket launchers to wield.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the Like a Dragon series? The story and characters The combat The side activities The virtual tourism aspect The general quirkiness Other - let us know in the comments! Answer See Results\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as the bonds between each member of your party strengthens additional supporting moves are unlocked to create powerful chain reactions, to the point that you can intentionally knock an enemy towards another team member and have them spike them face-first into the dirt like they\u2019re a human volleyball, or sweep kick an enemy off their feet and into the air and have one of your teammates jump-kick them to the curb \u2013 not unlike the XCOM-inspired team moves from Marvel\u2019s Midnight Suns and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.\n\nControlling Kiryu offers the closest resemblance to the series\u2019 street fighting of old, since he\u2019s able to switch between three fighting stances: Brawler for balanced attacks; Rush, which gives you two consecutive attacks per turn; and Beast for devastating grapple moves. Additionally, Kiryu is also able to gradually fill his trademark Heat gauge which, when triggered, gives you full control of his movement for a brief period and allows you to unleash a series of simple yet supremely satisfying button-based combos in real-time. Kiryu was my favourite character to use in Infinite Wealth by far, but even when he was absent from my party the combat remained considerably more kinetic than it ever was in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. This game delivers a riotous level of chaos and carnage that makes its predecessor\u2019s more modest turn-taking seem almost polite by comparison.\n\n\u201c Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth delivers a riotous level of chaos and carnage.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Infinite Wealth consistently adds interesting wrinkles to each fighting arena that forced me to switch up my strategies. One boss fight in a flaming forest had me scrambling for smoldering logs to snatch up and swing around in order to dish out more savage burns than an insult comic, while another skirmish in a room full of poisonous gas added a greater sense of urgency to each of my turns as I frantically hurried to end the fight before my entire squad collapsed. In one late-game battle aboard a tugboat I was able to intentionally knock enemies into the open maw of a great white shark waiting in the waters, then watch as the beast shook them around and then hurled them back into battle bleeding from a latticework of lacerations. Although there are certainly some repetitive random encounters to be found out in the streets, the bulk of Infinite Wealth\u2019s story mission encounters are gripping to play and extremely hard to forget.\n\nTricks of the Trade\n\nThe job system from Yakuza: Like a Dragon returns in Infinite Wealth, allowing you to alter the class of each character to best suit the makeup of your party. Last time around I tried to have an Idol on my team at all times due to their invaluable support abilities, and I persisted with that safety-first strategy in Infinite Wealth and found it just as reliable here. But otherwise, I found the new jobs to be considerably more appealing than those of the previous adventure, and I enjoyed shuffling them around the remaining members of my squad, whether it was Kasuga as a wetsuited Aquanaut Point Break-ing noses with his surfboard attacks, Adachi as a katana-swinging Samurai, or newcomer Tomizawa dual-weilding a pair of pistols as a dusty Desperado. With each job class I added into the rotation, Infinite Wealth\u2019s colourful clashes started to feel even less like standard turn-based scraps and more like fights that had broken out at a cosplay competition.\n\nSome jobs I favoured for their practical value, such as Heiress, which allows you to lob different grenade types that inflict status effects on wide groups of enemies. Others, though, I chose purely based on how entertaining they were to use. I never knew how badly I wanted to see Kiryu impersonate Bruce Lee until he was clad in the yellow Game of Death jumpsuit and fly-kicking and high-pitch-squealing all over my television screen as the nunchuck-wielding action star. Each job expands with a growing number of special attacks as you level them up, and almost every one of these are as damaging as they are dazzling \u2013 I never got tired of throwing a frisbee to an enemy goon and watching their confused looks as they caught it\u2026 just before they were set upon by a pack of exceptionally aggressive puppies to rapidly nibble away at their health bars, for example.\n\n\u201c I never knew how badly I wanted to see Kiryu impersonate Bruce Lee.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a greatly expanded list of jobs to take on, actually playing Infinite Wealth never feels like a chore. One of my biggest gripes with Yakuza: Like a Dragon\u2019s campaign was that my progress stalled when frustrating difficulty spikes in its latter half sent me off to repeatedly grind for experience points for hours on end in order to slowly increase the levels of my party members. This sort of stonewalling of story progress might be fairly commonplace in the JRPG genre, but personally I\u2019m not a fan of playing games that feel too much like work \u2013 and neither, it seems, are the designers behind Infinite Wealth.\n\nI\u2019m happy to report that I ran into no such roadblocks in this campaign, and although the challenge and intensity in its marathon final chapter ramps up more often than an inner city car park, I never encountered any overpowered bosses capable of wiping out my team in a single blow or other cheap tricks. Some of the fiercest fights at the pointy end of the story may have felt somewhat attritional but never unfair, and I generally felt like I was always there (or thereabouts) in matching the power level of the enemies I was confronted by without having to go out of my way to play catch up. It helps that you\u2019re typically given a heads up about the recommended level for your squad members and gear before you head into each major battle sequence, so I never found myself inadvertently progressing beyond a point of no return and getting caught with my pants down. I just caught plenty of trenchcoat-clad creeps with their pants down instead.\n\nLoading Play\n\nThat said, while I definitely appreciated the more gradual difficulty curve in Infinite Wealth and found it manageable as someone who doesn\u2019t play a lot of turn-based JRPGs, it does strike me as being a little odd that there are no difficulty settings to speak of for your first playthrough of the story. Unlike last year\u2019s Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name or other modern JRPGs like Final Fantasy VII: Remake, there\u2019s no way to throttle the challenge up or down until you beat the story and unlock the more challenging Hard and Legend modes. Why lock the option to increase the difficulty behind over potentially 50 hours of gameplay? Even if you loved a game that long on the first run, it\u2019s a lot to ask to immediately go again.\n\nConversely, if you\u2019re finding Infinite Wealth too tough the first time around, the absence of an easy mode means your only option is to grind through both of its two randomly generated dungeons in order to over-level yourself to be more resilient to enemy attacks, which seems equally impractical. In this era of improved accessibility, the lack of difficulty options in Infinite Wealth seems slightly behind the times. Still, I suppose at least Sega isn't charging extra for an easy mode, like it seemingly is with New Game+.\n\nKawaii Hawaii\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a Like a Dragon adventure if there wasn\u2019t an enormous amount of supplemental content to enjoy, and in that regard Infinite Wealth doesn\u2019t disappoint. Yakuza: Like a Dragon\u2019s Sujimon system, which basically allowed you to catch and catalogue peculiar men in place of pocket monsters, returns in Infinite Wealth \u2013 only now it\u2019s been greatly expanded to include countless limited-time-only raids, training, and stadium battles. Super Crazy Delivery is an addictive arcade time attack minigame that\u2019s effectively what would happen if a driver from Crazy Taxi hopped onto a DoorDash bike, and Sicko Mode tasks you with photographing a series of Speedo-clad musclemen who are hiding in bushes and startling the local dogs. But that\u2019s not as easy as it sounds because you do it as you\u2019re riding around a trolley circuit that hopefully doesn\u2019t go within a thousand feet of any local schools. Each of these are fun and extremely slick, and I\u2019m not just talking about the baby oil that\u2019s dripping off the sickos.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all \u2013 not by a long shot. One of the more extensive new side activities in Infinite Wealth is Dondoko Island, which could possibly have been called Animal Double-Crossing if Nintendo didn\u2019t have such expensive lawyers at its disposal. This separate resort island that you can travel to from the main Honolulu area allows you to cut down trees, smash rocks, and clear out trash bags in order to gather resources, which can then be used to craft a staggering number of furniture and structures used to beautify your own home and surrounding areas of the island in order to lure new guests.\n\nLoading Play\n\nYou can also fish, catch bugs, and fend off occasional attacks from pirates, and the best part of all is that there\u2019s no Tom Nook to continually bust your balls about the bells you owe him. It all works well and seems surprisingly deep, and although my modest interior and exterior design skills haven\u2019t been enough to elevate my island rating beyond a one-star level thus far, I\u2019m keen to invest more hours into it now that I\u2019ve finished the main story \u2013 if for no other reason than the fact that Kasuga\u2019s entertainingly manic crafting sequences make him seem less like a carpenter and more like a member of an F1 pit crew.\n\nWhile I felt that the substories in Like a Dragon Gaiden lacked a bit of spark, it\u2019s clear that developer Ryu Ga Gotuku Studio was saving its best material for Infinite Wealth since it managed to pleasantly surprise me on almost every other street I explored. At one point I stumbled into serving as a stuntman on an action movie set, swerving on foot through high-speed traffic and explosions like I was trapped inside the most frantic and fiery form of Frogger. Later I volunteered to be a contestant on a quirky escape room TV show, and had to sneak through a shopping mall answering trivia questions about the local area for bonus points. That sort of thing made for a stimulating change of pace.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s clear that developer Ryu Ga Gotuku Studio was saving its best material for Infinite Wealth.\n\nThe best part about it all is that you\u2019re constantly earning experience points and unlocking new combat moves and other useful features, whether you\u2019re fighting or not. You can get regular dopamine hits by hitting dopes and meanies, but you can also unlock unique combo attacks to perform with your allies simply by having a beer with them in between brawls \u2013 at the same time gaining an insight into their backstories and better fleshing out their characters.\n\nIn fact, almost everything in Infinite Wealth seems worthwhile in more ways than one, and there\u2019s a dizzying amount of enjoyable things to do. It seems like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has put everything but the kitchen sink into Infinite Wealth, but for all I know there might be a giant sink boss possibly named Drain Johnson lurking in one of its dungeons, flanked by his offsiders Tap-tain America and Farrah Faucet. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be surprised, especially since at one point I very much did come up against one unlikely boss in the form of an anthropomorphic cigarette. Defeating it was certainly a new way to kick some butt.\n\nInfinite Wealth also benefits from countless minor design decisions that combine to make for a more seamless experience, such as the ability to fast travel to cab ranks from any point on the map, or the option to see which weapons are in stock at each store at a glance without having to actually visit them. I particularly like how groups of enemies in the world feature colour-coded symbols so that you know which ones to engage with and which to give a wide berth without finding out the hard way. Once you become too powerful for certain enemy types you can just tap the left trigger to instantly wipe them out and snatch some cash and XP, rather than having to go through the motions of wasting time on a fight that you\u2019re always going to win comfortably. There\u2019s not quite an Infinite Wealth of intelligent ideas like these, but there\u2019s certainly a healthy surplus."

        "text": "The Tekken series is steeped in legacy. From the mechanical skills and knowledge needed to compete at the highest levels, to its iconic music and characters, to inside jokes spanning three decades and an ongoing story dating back just as far, each new entry has a heavy burden to bear. How do you honor that legacy without being chained down by it? That is the question Tekken 8 thoughtfully considers, and the answer it comes up with is a simple, yet profound one: you accept what\u2019s come before, but you don\u2019t let it stop you from moving forward. Whether it be a literal dash forward using the powerful new Heat system, impressive training tools, or the compelling story of a man trying to break generational shackles to create a brighter future, Tekken 8 is always honoring its past while striving to improve its present. And most of all, it\u2019s just some really good-ass Tekken.\n\nWho Is Tekken 8's Greatest Fighter? Pick a winner New duel 1ST 2ND 3RD See your Results Finish playing for your personal results or see the community\u2019s! Continue playingSee results\n\nThey say if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it, and Bandai Namco smartly hasn\u2019t tried to change the parts of Tekken\u2019s combat mechanics that were already great. Movement, spacing, block punishing, and whiff punishing all remain as vital as ever, but two significant additions also twist those mechanics in exciting ways: recoverable health, and the Heat System.\n\nFor the first time in Tekken history, other than the Tekken Tag Tournament games, recoverable health plays a major part in matches. Blocking big attacks and taking chip damage, absorbing them with a Power Crush, or being hit after getting knocked airborne will do partial gray damage. The only way to get this health back is by throwing out your own attacks, as you won\u2019t recover at all by just standing still and blocking \u2013 you have to go on the offensive to reclaim your life, and this made me adapt my mindset in a wonderful way.\n\nIt\u2019s also a huge shift, as Tekken has always been a defensive game. It\u2019s not uncommon to watch high-level Tekken matches of the past and see two characters appear to almost glitch across the screen as they continuously cancel their sidesteps and dashes and block everything while looking for the smallest opening. A lot of that hasn\u2019t gone away in Tekken 8, but recoverable damage gave me the constant pressure to go on offense while I still had health that could be recovered, and never made me feel like I was out of the fight while being juggled across the stage.\n\n\u201c You have to go on the offensive to reclaim your life, and this made me adapt my mindset in a wonderful way.\n\nThe new Heat system pairs with this new offensive mindset perfectly. There are myriad ways to enter Heat, whether it be through landing staple moves from a character\u2019s move list or simply pressing a button, and you start with a full bar of Heat every round, so there\u2019s no reason not to use it. Heat enhances your offense in every facet \u2013 you do increased chip damage while recovering more of your own health, you unlock new moves or properties for each character, and you can use the rest of your meter for a powerful combo extender or finisher.\n\nDo you press your advantage when you have your enemy on the ropes, or do you wait for an opportunity to recover health? Do you add a little bit of damage onto a combo now, or maintain stronger pressure after a knockdown later? Since you regain all of your Heat after every round, these are questions you get to answer every round, and Tekken 8 is much more dynamic for it.\n\nThe 10 Best Fighting Games 11 Images\n\nThat said, one aspect of these changes I could see eventually getting frustrating is how it gives even more offensive pressure to characters who thrive on it, like Hwoarang and the various members of the Mishima family. It\u2019s scary enough to try and keep blocking when it seems like it\u2019s been your opponent\u2019s turn to attack forever, so adding in chip damage and extra tools for characters with overwhelming offense is even more to deal with. But since these tools are universal, you always have a chance to turn the tide yourself, and Heat makes execution for a lot of moves easier, such as the Mishimas\u2019 electric attacks no longer requiring a single-frame input. Heat is both your most powerful offensive tool and a great equalizer.\n\nOn top of Heat naturally smoothing out the beginner\u2019s on-ramp a bit, Tekken 8 also has some of the best training tools I\u2019ve ever seen in a fighting game. The new Arcade Quest mode is a great way to slowly ramp up the difficulty of CPU opponents, and the Training Mode is incredibly full featured, with combo challenges, save states (so you can drill specific situations like wall breaks easily), punishment training, moves you can pin to the screen while practicing them, and handy notes and icons that tell you the specific properties of each attack.\n\nWhich Tekken 8 training feature do you expect to find the most useful? Save States Pinning Moves to the Screen Move Demonstrations Frame Data Punishment Training Replay Takeover Answer See Results\n\nBut the crown jewel is the integrated replay system. You can watch your own replays back, or even those of other players you find online, and take control of the characters at any time, as long as they were played by a human. That means as soon as you run into a troublesome situation in a match, you can immediately hop into your replays, watch back what you did, and then try a dozen different ways to find something better. It\u2019s a phenomenal addition, and one I\u2019ll be using constantly as I strive to improve.\n\nTo simplify things even further, there\u2019s also a control mode called Special Style that binds important moves to a single button press. You can even bind the Special Style toggle to a button that you can press mid-match if you\u2019re getting overwhelmed and just want to do something cool and productive \u2013 the menu will pop on screen, even when playing online, so both players will know when someone activates it.\n\n\u201c The replay mode is a phenomenal addition, and one I'll be using constantly as I strive to improve.\n\nHowever, Special Style isn\u2019t useful in any way that\u2019s viable competitively. Unlike Street Fighter 6\u2019s comparatively paltry moveset being downsized with its Modern Controls mode, Tekken characters have dozens if not hundreds of moves, and you can\u2019t realistically map a majority of those to four buttons. You can alter some of them by pressing a direction as well, but Special Style is mainly meant for beginners and those who want a quick taste of what a character can do, which it does provide nicely.\n\nNew Challengers\n\nJoining the roster\u2019s returning mainstays are three fighters new to the Tekken series. Victor, the French UN Agent voiced by actor Vincent Cassell, Azucena, the energetic coffee entrepreneur, and the enigmatic Reina.\n\nVictor sports some really flashy attacks that look cool as soon as you pick him up, and his vanishing strikes have great mixup and pressure options that are, thankfully, able to be punished if abused too often. His connection to the story is a nice addition to the lore as well, framing him as a character who has been in the background training other longtime roster mainstays.\n\nAzucena, as befitting of her occupation, is always moving. Both her personality and moveset are always baiting you to attack, and then hammering you hard for it. She\u2019s destined to be polarizing due to her taunting nature and obvious early strengths, but even after fighting against her many times, I am more excited to learn ways around her pressure than I am frustrated to face her.\n\nWhat We Said About Tekken 7 Loading Play Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far. \u2013 Darry Huskey, June 2, 2017 Score: 9.5 Note: Since 2020, IGN has scored on a 1-10 scale. Read the full Tekken 7 review\n\nThe third and most intriguing new character is Reina, who seems to act as a bridge between Tekken 7 and 8 in both gameplay and story. Seemingly appearing from nowhere, she shares many moves with the recently deceased Heihachi, the patriarch of the Mishima family who was killed by Kazuya at the end of Tekken 7, and she\u2019s my favorite addition to the roster by far. She\u2019s aggressive, flashy, and has some simple tools that will be very hard to master.\n\nMore Than Just Heat Mode\n\nContinuing an extremely welcome trend of recent fighting games, Tekken 8 has enough single player content to keep you busy for dozens of hours without ever even touching multiplayer. The cinematic story mode, subtitled The Dark Awakens, is a roughly three-to-four-hour mix of cutscenes and story battles, and while I can\u2019t give away many details, there are a few surprises that should delight longtime Tekken fans, including multiple playable characters. It seems like a good way to showcase Special Style, too, as story weaves in and out of fights and in-game slow motion is used to punctuate big moves \u2013 I actually found using it more enjoyable than the regular controls for most of the story since I wasn\u2019t browsing a move list every time I played as a new character. There\u2019s plenty of time to dig deep and try hard in all the other modes, so I was glad to just be able to have fun quickly for this campaign.\n\n\u201c Story mode has a few surprises that should delight longtime Tekken fans.\n\nAs far as the actual story goes, I mostly enjoyed my time with it. There are some very \u201ccapital A Anime\u201d moments, and not everyone gets a chance to shine, but Bandai Namco gives attention to important character arcs that span several games, and there are clear fan-service moments that land successfully. It\u2019s simple enough to understand as a newcomer, too, as the relationships and stakes are laid out pretty clearly from the jump and the Gallery mode includes several summary videos of past games. One of the only negatives presentation-wise is that the real-time action looks so good that the transitions into pre-rendered cutscenes can sometimes be jarring, especially with some slightly smeary effects and different color grading layered on top of them.\n\nIn a return to Tekken tradition, there are also character endings for the entire roster that unlock by playing through a quick series of five battles. These are mostly played for goofs, and they do vary in quality, but there are a few that had me legitimately laughing out loud. I won\u2019t spoil any, but make sure you play through Kazuya and Dragunov\u2019s endings in particular for some fun moments.\n\nNew to the series in Tekken 8 are two modes: Arcade Quest and Super Ghost Battle. Arcade Quest is actually my favorite of the single player options; mimicking a crawl through various arcades, your customizable avatar moves through different opponents while slowly learning Tekken 8\u2019s mechanics. You can spend as much time as you want in each location challenging characters, all of whom sport different playstyles to test your mettle against. There\u2019s a passable story that preaches the importance of having fun in a stressful genre, but it really works as a lengthy tutorial for those who may be a bit hesitant to immediately jump online. Arcade Quest gives you a ton of encouragement as you go, and it should provide players intimidated by Tekken\u2019s high difficulty a reason to stick around without meeting some of the vitriol you\u2019d see with real-life bad actors.\n\nSuper Ghost Battle is a mode in which you can challenge a CPU that\u2019s built from learning actual information about players. You can train your own ghost by fighting against it in order to learn your own tendencies, or even download and play against ghosts from other players. It\u2019s a great way to check yourself as you continue to grow into a given character, and also a fun way to take on other real-life people without having to actually schedule play time. I\u2019ve already had friends tell me that they beat up my ghost in a nice bit of catharsis after I won a set against them online.\n\nWhich Tekken has the best soundtrack? Tekken Tekken 2 Tekken 3 Tekken 4 Tekken 5 Tekken 6 Tekken 7 Tekken Tag Tournament Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Tekken Revolution Answer See Results\n\nThe last single player mode of note is the Jukebox. It lets you replace the music for any stage as you see fit, including the track they switch to in the final round, and even includes both some of the menu music and classic tracks from Tekken\u2019s past. And if you don\u2019t feel like fiddling, you can set it to shuffle the soundtracks of Tekkens 1 through 8, Tekken Tag Tournament 1 and 2, and even Tekken Revolution. It\u2019s an embarrassment of riches for longtime fans of the series like me, and a great way to honor its legacy. Plus, now I can listen to the awesome Tekken 3 Character Select music anytime I want. And I want. Please put this in every fighting game.\n\nOnline\n\nThe biggest factor in the longevity of any modern fighting game is how well it plays online, and I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s here Tekken 8 trumps Tekken 7 in every way. Based on the limited online time I\u2019ve had pre-launch, netcode seems much improved, and every match I\u2019ve played against someone in the US (even thousands of miles away) has felt great. I also tried my hand against players in South Korea and Europe, and while the quality wasn\u2019t ideal, the matches were definitely playable \u2013 albeit with some jittery artifacts. There are several rollback settings to change the feel of your inputs as well, although I preferred the default. Regardless, it\u2019s great that the option is there if you want it, and Tekken 8 includes cross-play as well!\n\nAlso, in an extremely welcome change from Tekkens past, online rematches are now considerably faster. Instead of bumping you out to the versus splash screen as you wait for another load, it will put you right back in the action as soon as you confirm a rematch. It\u2019s a great update, and one of those things that makes you forget how long it actually used to take once you get used to it.\n\nLoading Play\n\nAs far as online modes go, the big focus here is the Tekken Fight Lounge, a battle hub where you can run around with your custom avatar to meet and inspect other players, throw down some emotes, and access all the online options, including Ranked Matches, Quick Matches, Custom Rooms, and the welcome return of Tekken Ball. It\u2019s easy to navigate as you can pop open the menu to quickly hop from room to room, but it\u2019s also just a cool looking space to run around in its own right. And if it\u2019s not for you, you can just as easily find all the online modes from the main menu.\n\nUnfortunately, one bizarre omission while in custom rooms is that you can\u2019t spectate matches or go to the practice mode. You can spectate anyone just fine from the Fight Lounge, but if you\u2019re in a room with friends, as of now, there\u2019s no way to watch each other\u2019s matches. Tekken 8 gets so much right about the online experience that this is a weird thing to not have available. Hopefully it gets added in a post-launch patch."

        "text": "I fell in love with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time way back in 2003, when it helped redefine 3D action-adventure games with its clever rewind ability enhancing its environmental puzzles and fast, acrobatic combat. But while the aughts saw a bunch of sequels with similar elements, none ever quite hit the same heights as The Sands of Time \u2013 and the 2010s were a parched desert for the series. But like an oasis, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown finally nails what I loved about those classic Prince of Persia games, and it does so by placing the series' best ideas within a 2D Metroidvania framework that calls back to the roots of the 1989 original.\n\nThe Lost Crown excels in both the elements that make for a great Prince of Persia: platforming and combat. The 3D games sometimes struggle with cameras that can be tough to wrangle in tight spaces or that make it difficult to gauge distances, and often solve the problem by just locking the camera in place in tricky spots. Combat has a similar problem: parkour-like fighting moves are always cool, but it can be tough to pull them off well, especially against multiple opponents. By bringing the whole game to a 2D viewpoint, The Lost Crown is able to hone in on precise, snappy controls that always feel great and you can always see exactly what you need to.\n\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown Gameplay Screenshots 13 Images\n\nLike The Sands of Time and 2008's Prince of Persia reboot, The Lost Crown constitutes a reimagining of the series' concept, striking out in its own direction but maintaining some familiarity. The enticing basics are the same: As a quick, acrobatic protagonist, you explore a massive, semi-ruined location covered in deadly traps and filled with various soldiers and monsters you must overcome with strength and cunning, and time shenanigans are afoot. The similarities end there, though, as The Lost Crown tells a new story based in Persian mythology, leaning into an adventure filled with cool characters that are often pretty interesting, although the plot can get tripped up in its details and delivery as you explore the maze-like map.\n\nAt the heart of the tale are the Immortals, a group of seven nearly superheroic warriors, dispatched to the legendary Mount Qaf to rescue the kidnapped prince of Persia, Ghassan. You play as Sargon, the youngest and most brash of the group, whose struggles both with proving his place among the Immortals and with chasing down his mentor, responsible for the kidnapping, make him a compelling character throughout the twisty, though somewhat predictable, journey. Sargon is a fierce, fast warrior, and while this is a Metroidvania and unlocking new abilities over time is an essential element of the formula, he's a capable fighter from the start. In fact, The Lost Crown's focus on giving you plenty of tools in combat right away is a huge part of why it works so well. Fighting enemies is as compelling as exploring the sprawling map thanks to combat that emphasizes speed, reaction time, and pressing your advantage.\n\n\u201c This combat system often moves at an almost breakneck pace.\n\nThis combat system often moves at an almost breakneck pace. Sargon's speed is his greatest advantage, and even basic enemies hit hard enough that you need to take them seriously. It\u2019s a balance that creates situations where you always need to be reading enemy movements, and your best bet is usually to keep moving and keep attacking. The threat most enemies present kept every battle exciting and important across my 25 hours in Mount Qaf, even on the \"normal\" difficulty mode, and the fun comes from learning to master everything at your disposal. The Lost Crown sports four difficulty options, as well as the ability to customize things like enemy health and damage and parry window size, and combat is exciting enough that I'm looking forward to starting new runs on the tougher levels to put my skills to the test.\n\nOne of The Lost Crown\u2019s best ideas is to increase its focus on melee action beyond what you might expect from a Metroidvania\u2019s combat system \u2014 almost Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice meets Devil May Cry. Your goal in fights is to create and maintain combos that can give you an advantage. Kicking smaller enemies into the air allows you to juggle them and keep them from fighting back, while the goal with larger enemies is usually to get behind their defenses to evade their blows while ravaging them with your own. In addition to regular strikes, upward and downward attacks, and aerial maneuvers, Sargon also has moves that chain off dodges and slides, and heavier attacks that can be charged up or change depending on when you execute them in a chain. You wind up with lots of different moves at your disposal that can be linked together in different ways depending on the situation and the enemy you're fighting. All of Sargon's attacks are simple and easy to execute, but still made him feel like a fierce warrior at all times, especially as I learned how to read opponents and pull off combos that allowed me to absolutely dominate them.\n\nWhat's your favorite part of 2D Metroidvanias? Expansive maps Finding secrets Fighting enemies Platforming challenges Unlocking new abilities Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results\n\nAdding to the thrill is the fact that combat is so damn stylish. Sargon and the other Immortals who appear as NPCs zip across battlefields at impossible speeds as bright colors splash over the background. You don't have a proper block, but you can parry some moves, and parrying specific, powerful attacks triggers a quick execution cutscene that eliminates regular enemies outright with flair, rewarding you for understanding your opponent and reacting quickly. Miss a parry, however, and you're left vulnerable; The Lost Crown will show you just how bad you messed up with a giant splash of red as you take your hit.\n\nFlashy sequences also mark Sargon's special Athra Surge abilities, which you'll unlock as you progress through the story and have to be charged up by damaging enemies. But when you jump through those hoops you\u2019ll be able to do things like throw several foes into the air at once, create a healing field, or fire a hugely powerful arrow. They all come with their own cool cutscene animations that emphasize the power you're unleashing.\n\nNever is combat better than in boss battles, though. All the same rules of regular battles apply, with attacks that can be parried and some that trigger counters to land a huge, cinematic hit. But bosses all have similar tools to your own, like unparryable moves that have to be dodged, and even their own Athra abilities that you have to learn and avoid.\n\n\u201c As with combat, platforming is consistently excellent.\n\nOne boss trounced me again and again by using a counterattack ability that triggered when I hit him \u2014 not only did he turn my attack against me, but I got to be humiliated by a killer cutscene as he buried a kamehameha-like blast of energy in Sargon's chest. These moments come across like gods clashing as a result, and The Lost Crown's bosses having abilities similar to yours makes them feel like true contests of skill.\n\nThe other half of The Lost Crown is its platforming gauntlet. As with combat, platforming is consistently excellent. In fact, your abilities are often so useful that you can work your way around obstacles with ingenuity rather than by unlocking a particular move. A few times, slipping under a ledge with a dash and linking that into a double jump, or carefully timing wall jumps, got me to places I didn't initially think I could reach. You can never perform quite so well that you wind up in places before you belong there (though I'm sure speedrunners will find a way to do just that), but there are a few times when being adept in platforming feels extra rewarding as you scale a mountain wall or across a deadly precipice.\n\nMost of the abilities you'll unlock while making your way through Mount Qaf will be familiar to Metroidvania fans \u2014 staples like a double-jump, a mid-air dash, and a grapple. In its platforming, The Lost Crown doesn't break the mold, but it does execute everything it attempts exceptionally well. Some really great, challenging level design will put you through your paces dodging swinging blades and avoiding spikes, and the obstacles you face never feel cheap or frustrating.\n\nLoading Play\n\nThe Lost Crown discards the time-rewinding power that defined most of the Prince of Persia games by allowing you to undo mistakes. Instead, when you fail during a platforming section, you're just returned to the last chunk of solid ground you touched with a little damage to your health bar. As long as you're not out of health, you're free to try again immediately. It isn't as thematically neat as the rewind feature, but it is functionally a quicker, cleaner approach to allowing you to adjust for your errors. It's rare that a platforming section feels too long or is annoying to repeat since you can make additional attempts almost instantly, and you only really suffer consequences when you fully run out of health.\n\nMount Qaf itself is a big map with a lot of impressive areas, each with a different feel and slate of mechanics. Again, the ideas at play here aren't rewriting the Metroidvania playbook, but they serve very well to provide a lot of variety and interesting obstacles. Each has its own vibes, enemies, and ideas, like an underground pirate harbor filled with explosives and ambushes, and an academy area where keeping quiet is necessary to avoid a towering, overzealous, blind librarian. You'll revisit each location over and over again as you unlock new abilities that make additional areas accessible, and they're all different enough that return trips remain interesting even late in the campaign.\n\n\u201c The map photo system is something every Metroidvania should emulate.\n\nThe Lost Crown also lets you snap a photo of a spot where you see something you can't currently reach or a puzzle you don't yet understand, which adds the image to your map. It's a brilliant system that every Metroidvania should emulate. On more than one occasion, checking over photos I'd taken early on led to \"Eureka!\" moments \u2014 like one in which I realized the solution to a puzzle that involved a crushing wall required placing a statue into the trap. I finally got it only after carefully examining the background of the room, littered with smashed statues, and thanks to the photo marking the spot, it was trivial to quickly return there. The system encourages you to find and solve everything Mount Qaf has to offer, and cuts down on the irritating need to scour an area for something you may have missed.\n\nMy favorite location was a sea battle frozen in time, where you can walk on waves mid-crash and see combatants flung by explosive cannon fire arrested in mid-air. As you progress, you eventually restart time for part of the area, forcing you to travel through the stormy battle even as other parts of the location are still frozen, creating a very cool effect. But it was elements like this sea battle that made me wish The Lost Crown leaned harder into its ideas about the broken flow of time, which is more something characters talk about than something that actually happens on screen. People will mention seeing different versions of the Immortals or even claim they've interacted with Sargon before you've met them, and these are some of The Lost Crown's most fascinating ideas \u2014 but it doesn't fully explore them.\n\nThat was a problem throughout the story, in fact. At points, I felt like I had missed things; after a particularly wonky bit of time-rearranging, Sargon keeps asking characters if they remember meeting him, as if he'd run into someone who had forgotten him because of the altered timeline. But if that person existed, I never found them, and nobody ever acted like time's shifts had stolen their memory of what I\u2019d experienced.\n\nThe same is true of one of The Lost Crown\u2019s side characters, who disappeared at one point never to be seen again, and I had one minor side quest that never seemed to advance correctly. Additionally, the relatively open, interconnected world of Mount Qaf sometimes plays against the story that takes place within it, where taking a certain path can cause you to miss events or reach them slightly out of order, which might have been interesting if this was a deliberate effect of the time-twisting story, but instead just makes things feel a bit jumbled and perplexing.\n\n\u201c The Lost Crown leaves parts of its story untold or confusing.\n\nEven after I finished, the whole tale seemed to have a few lingering plot holes. It might be that part of the story is locked behind the biggest and most arduous side quest, or it could be that the many collectible lore items are meant to fill in the gaps. But unless you attempt to get reasonably close to 100-percent completion, The Lost Crown leaves parts of its story untold and, as a result, other parts are confusing. As much as I liked the characters throughout, its conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying due to what seemed like missing pieces."

        "text": "Fortnite must be going through its third awakening right now. I haven\u2019t played a single round of Battle Royale for weeks, and that\u2019s mainly because I can no longer make it past the starting menu without running face-first into a flurry of full-sized spin-offs framed as new game modes. Fortnite Rocket Racing, an arcade racer that mixes ideas from both Rocket League and Fortnite, is one of them \u2013 and while it\u2019s very much in its infancy, this barebones first draft is fun enough to call it the beginning of what could become a great standalone racing game one day. But, even with 26 decently-designed maps, seamless integration into Fortnite\u2019s broader progression systems, and easy-to-setup cross-platform multiplayer for up to 12 players, Rocket Racing struggles to stay fresh after you\u2019ve seen through the cracks of its simplistic car handling and questionable multiplayer balance. Even with a great idea at the center of its circuit, it\u2019s difficult to declare this a Victory Royale.\n\nDon\u2019t let the Rocket League tie-in confuse you; Rocket Racing only shares its association with the previous game developed by Psyonix in that it also features toy cars doing physics-defying stunts. Instead, Rocket Racing tastefully borrows inspiration from games like Distance, Rollcage, Wipeout, and GRIP: Combat Racing. There are 12 cars on the map, each trying to reach the finish line first \u2013 pretty standard stuff, but Rocket Racing\u2019s twist on that formula is that drifting fills up your boost meter similar to Mario Kart, allowing you to zoom past the competition after gaining enough momentum. There are no items or weapons on the map like you\u2019d find in similar combat racers; instead, your sole focus is on maintaining your max speed while selectively drifting, boosting, and generally avoiding other players or obstacles that would slow you down.\n\nFortnite Rocket Racing Gameplay Screenshots 70 Images\n\nThis is a strong concept on its own, only made better by the added layer of depth jumping and flying introduces. You can tap a button to shoot your car into the air, and holding that same button down makes you fly (at the cost of your vehicle\u2019s speed). Likewise, you can use your car\u2019s jump and flight controls to quickly navigate out of the path of an obstacle by clinging to a wall or ceiling \u2013 kind of like in Distance. Keeping things interesting, it\u2019s great that each map presents different obstacles and alternate pathways that force you to choose your approach carefully, since you can easily miss speed boosts placed on the track or drift into a hazard, causing you to explode and respawn somewhere behind the rest of the pack.\n\nSpeed boosting is the name of the game, and there are several ways you can quickly boost ahead of the crowd\u2026 at least in theory. All this boosting and thrusting feels and sounds good in action, but there are a few esoteric systems under the hood which don\u2019t always feel transparent or fair \u2013 and that\u2019s where Rocket Racing\u2019s problems begin to appear. For instance, hitting the gas on the green light at the beginning of each match can give you up to 100% extra speed depending on your exact timing\u2026 but even when I timed it just right, it felt like I was consistently only landing 35-40% boosts.\n\n\u201c Its quick races can sit comfortably in moments between other activities.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that if you get too far behind, Rocket Racing goes out of its way to help you catch up with everyone else near the rear without putting in much effort. But even when I\u2019m clearly ahead of everyone else, it seems like my drifting and tight steering don\u2019t go quite as far to keep me ahead. Other players will miraculously appear out of nowhere, taking the lead just in time to steal my first place spot before I reach the finish line. It\u2019s understandable that there are protections in place to keep matches more interesting to the very end \u2013 especially considering the vast performance chasms Fortnite attempts to cover in its cross-platform matchmaking \u2013 but when Rocket Racing punishes you for doing well, it can speedily suck the fun out of playing competitively.\n\nAs with basically every other Fortnite game, there isn\u2019t much story or setup to worry about. You just tap a button to begin matchmaking, and soon you\u2019ll be off. To its benefit, Rocket Racing is one of those enjoyable casual games that sits comfortably in moments between other activities, seeing as how each match only lasts for three laps \u2013 or about three minutes. You\u2019re definitely not committing to a 15 or 20 minute multiplayer match ala Fortnite Battle Royale (you can probably finish four or five races in that same time), and being tied into Fortnite\u2019s popularity means you\u2019ll rarely find yourself without a buddy to play against.\n\nWhat do you think about Epic releasing full new games within Fortnite? It's weird, I wish they were standalone I already played Fortnite so it's fine by me I downloaded Fortnite just to try one (or more) of them I don't care either way Other (leave a comment below!) Answer See Results\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s seemingly not possible to play against another player locally, at least on the Xbox Series X, which is a bit of a drag since that feels like a staple of casual racers. It\u2019s at least fairly easy to get around that since Fortnite is free-to-play, so I\u2019ve already installed it on every platform I own. I\u2019m also impressed at how well its performance scales between the Nintendo Switch and PC, where I could compete against other players at roughly the same level of competence no matter which hardware I was using. I didn\u2019t feel as bad when I partied up with a group of friends across platforms as I might playing Battle Royale, no matter which system I or they were playing on.\n\nAside from a few network issues on my provider\u2019s end \u2013 which were present on every system I tested Rocket Racing on, over the course of an entire weekend \u2013 it\u2019s a smooth and tight experience no matter how beefy your gaming machine. I\u2019ve always been impressed by the wizardry behind Fortnite\u2019s multiplayer systems, allowing over a hundred players to coexist in the same map at once during Battle Royale matches, regardless of hardware. The chaos and high-speed action of Rocket Racing makes me appreciate that aforementioned wizardry even more, seeing as how hard it must be to keep everyone on even footing with this much stuff happening in this tight of a space.\n\n\u201c The main problem is that there\u2019s just not much to Rocket Racing right now.\n\nThe main problem with Rocket Racing is that there\u2019s just not much to it right now. Even though it has 26 maps, most of them rarely make it into circulation, which leaves the impression that there is significantly less stuff to see. Softening that blow, Fortnite still lets you scroll down a list and select one map to play at a time \u2013 and this is especially useful if you\u2019re sick of the popular rotation \u2013 but its current way of facilitating that choice isn\u2019t all that convenient. The amount of time needed to find a match slows down dramatically if you have to manually select a specific map from the list every time instead of opting for general matchmaking, and it\u2019s not like you can pick and choose a bunch of maps to plot out your own custom playlist.\n\nAt least those maps \u2013 even the ones on repeat \u2013 are well-designed and enjoyable to replay. For instance, Bone Cavern features a series of tunnels filled with obstacles that encourage tricky use of flying and wall-riding, and it can be a lot of fun to watch other players miss their jump and crash head-first into a hazard. Moments like this are so hectic, I\u2019m instantly reminded of games like Mario Party or Fall Guys.\n\nLoading Play\n\nCar customization, on the other hand, is a total non-starter. Each of these unremarkable toy cars handles the same, and there\u2019s absolutely no variation in performance to speak of \u2013 even if you do unlock different visual car designs. It\u2019s genuinely unclear how to unlock new vehicles and cosmetics anyway, other than by earning the scant few cars available on the higher tiers of the Fortnite Battle Pass. I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll eventually need to pay V-Bucks for the privilege of owning different and better-looking rides, but until then, it\u2019s boring to stare at the same cars over and over again.\n\nI\u2019m ultimately left conflicted on whether I enjoy Rocket Racing\u2019s integration into Fortnite\u2019s progression and Battle Pass system. On the one hand, it\u2019s nice that the levels I\u2019m earning in Rocket Racing are contributing to my level in Battle Royale and vice versa; especially since the cars I do eventually earn can be used as vehicle skins in the Battle Royale mode. But on the other hand, it feels like most of my leveling to earn those cars will be done in other modes once I get bored with Rocket Racing \u2013 and after that happens, it\u2019ll just fade back into being a minigame that I ignore in favor of everything else in Fortnite\u2019s expanding armada of stuff."

        "text": "If there\u2019s one genre that lends itself to boom or bust, it's the online shooter. For every success like Call of Duty, Halo, or Apex Legends, it seems like there are at least a dozen other games that have come and gone with barely a spark before they fizzle. With so many good competitive shooters in play, what makes one stand out? After dozens of hours I\u2019m beginning to see how The Finals answers those questions: with an excellent gameshow-infused style and a brilliantly destructible playground.\n\nIf the 1987 movie The Running Man were about 3v3v3 gun battles, it would\u2019ve resembled The Finals. You and two teammates face off against other three-person squads in a virtual gameshow, vying to see who can be the first to score enough cash before time runs out. The vibrant color palette combines with a pair of live sports-style play-by-play announcers to give it that over-the-top, American Gladiators feel that people in the \u201880s thought was going to be the future of sports. That strikes a great balance of not taking itself too seriously without making it a total joke or becoming obnoxious.\n\nThe Finals Review Screenshots 18 Images\n\nThere are currently two main modes: the first, Quick Cash, has each team vying to collect a vault of coins and deposit it at a designated spot on the map, which tends to result in the bloody convergence of all three squads at those points. This really effectively keeps the action going, and because taking over the deposit doesn\u2019t reset its progress, rounds move at a steady pace and avoid momentum-killing stalemates altogether.\n\nMeanwhile the Bank It mode focuses a bit more on direct PvP battles, but they also tend to be more scattered. Here, each player carries coins in their virtual pockets, all of which is gathered either from vaults around the map or by eliminating enemies. The on-the-fly strategizing of going for kills one second and then needing to deposit your loot before it all goes to waste the next is exciting, and it\u2019s pretty fun to eliminate someone right in front of the bank so you can deposit all their coins yourself.\n\n\u201c Quick Cash really effectively keeps the action moving.\n\nIndividually, both modes are well designed and generally very fun. The fact that The Finals is limited to just those two options, however, is a red flag. If the player base starts to grow tired of these game types and there aren\u2019t any other options, there is a real possibility of people moving on before too long. While I didn\u2019t find that to be an issue during my time playing, that does present a potential concern for the long-term health of this community that I hope is addressed with new modes in future updates.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve played a few matches you\u2019ll unlock tournaments, and this is where the competitive attitude of The Finals really shines. The primary tournament mode puts you and seven other teams in a bracket playing modified versions of Cashout. Two games of four teams each run simultaneously, with the top two squads from each game advancing to the second round. The top two teams from that game then face off in a direct 3v3 match to determine the overall winner. It does a great job mixing the high stakes nature of an actual competition with rounds that are fast and satisfying enough to elicit that \u201cjust one more game\u201d feeling after each tournament. There\u2019s even a ranked version, where players can move up in leagues based on their performance.\n\nWhat's your favorite PvP shooter mode?

The Light build, for example, focuses on mobility, trading stopping power for a grappling hook to quickly get to high or far places. The Medium, meanwhile, is an all-arounder, and has abilities that focus on support, such as its healing beam. Finally, there\u2019s the Heavy, which could have been taken straight from Rainbow Six: Siege, as it alternates between controlling the battlefield with heavy weapons and smashing through walls like the Juggernaut.\n\nThere\u2019s a solid variety of equipment for you to choose from before each match, and they can have a major impact on the battlefield if used properly. There are standard choices, like frag grenades and deployable cover, and those are tried and true options that do what you\u2019d expect \u2013 but they hardly stand out when you can instead drop jump pads that launch you high into the air, or goo grenades that can seal large spaces with an expanding foam. Some options are universal, like the pyro grenades, while others are restricted to specific classes, like the Medium builds\u2019 defibrillator that instantly revive downed teammates.\n\n\u201c Hopefully future updates can even the balance out.\n\nThose choices are undermined, however, as balance issues are a bit of a concern at the moment. Heavies tend to be ubiquitous in competitive modes, and their huge health pool and high damage output makes it easy to see why. Certain weapons like the flamethrower, grenade launcher, and sword seem to make up an outsized portion of the player arsenal I\u2019ve come across as well. Hopefully future updates can even things out, but as it is, a lightweight build with the semi-automatic battle rifle, for example, really struggles to compete with the rest of the meta, and that\u2019s a shame.\n\nEach character archetype also has a litany of cosmetics that can be unlocked through XP progression or by spending real world money. There\u2019s a pretty solid assortment to choose from right out of the gate, though the amount of time it takes to unlock good looking items (without taking out your wallet) is in need of major retuning. After 20 hours, the best I could afford was some fanny packs and tights on one character, which makes getting the whole squad glammed up feel like a pipe dream.\n\nLoading Play\n\nThat slow progression is also true of VRs, the in-game \u201ccash\u201d you earn for playing that\u2019s used to unlock non-cosmetic things like different abilities, weapons, and gadgets. I get that there needs to be a balance between giving you everything too soon, which can take away the joy of progression, and making it take too long to earn things, but right now The Finals skews a bit too much towards the latter. It\u2019s hard to experiment with builds when all the pieces for each character are locked behind dozens of hours of matches.\n\nMultibucks are the paid premium currency, and the cosmetic items that can only be purchased with them are the right mix of being unique enough to consider, but not necessary for folks who don\u2019t want to spend the money. They are the flashiest items by far, and include things like an Elvis-style jumpsuit in the paid battle pass, or gold skins for your weapons you can buy outright. Importantly, nothing restricted to Multibucks offers a competitive advantage, so there\u2019s no pay to win option \u2013 especially since VRs can only be earned through playing. None of the premium stuff is essential either, with the possible exception of the tin-foil hat wearing Conspirakitten that can ride your shoulder into battle. That\u2019s just too adorable to pass up.\n\n\u201c The destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals.\n\nThe destructibility of each stage is the real star of The Finals. Sure, you can enter a room from the door or window. But taking the less obvious path of crashing right through the ceiling is a thrilling way to get the drop on unsuspecting teams, and you haven\u2019t really played The Finals until you\u2019ve stolen the vault by blowing a hole in an upper floor and had it drop right in front of you. By the end of a tense match, the battlefield is often littered with debris from entire buildings beginning to collapse.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to that system than some cool rubble and an ad hoc door, too, as the strategic impact is huge. One map is high atop skyscrapers connected by sky bridges, and I sat in stunned silence the first time I saw a team destroy the section where a bridge met a building, causing the entire thing to collapse to the ground below. Split second judgment calls when buildings fall around you about whether to jump off or ride the debris down can make or break firefights and create unforgettable moments \u2013 like when my entire team was dead in the final seconds of a match, and the only thing that stopped another team from stealing the bank for the win was the amount of rubble they had to dig through to reach it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have many friends to share those triumphant victories with, matchmaking as a solo player is quick and easy, and the single button ping system makes it simple to communicate with random people without needing to be on a mic. There\u2019s nothing to be gained by ignoring objectives and going for straight kills, so teammates tend to do a good job being focused on the task, making solo play very viable. It does have one glaring weakness, however: in matches where I either didn\u2019t get grouped into a full three-person team, or someone left mid-fight, people were rarely pulled into our team to refill our ranks. It\u2019s very disheartening to be in a match by yourself, knowing you have no shot at winning and no reason to hold out hope that help is going to arrive.\n\nThere will always be an element of luck in the quality of teammates you are matched with, which is a big part of why The Finals (as with most team-based shooters) is better across the board with people you know. It\u2019s so much fun to coordinate an assault with friends, or to seize the bank and then protect it with mines and defensive structures. It\u2019s also a huge advantage to work together. A flamethrower wielding Heavy supported by a healing beam from a Medium can wipe an entire team, and the strategic element of choosing complimentary builds and kits is very engaging. When someone dies, they leave an action figure behind that can be used to revive them, and scooping one up so you can find a safe place to bring them back is as useful as it is hilarious. (Crossplay and progression also made it quite nice to be able to bounce back and forth between different friends on my PC and Xbox Series X without missing a beat.)"

        "text": "A lot of RPGs assume you're just some nobody with a sword trying to make their way in a strange and hostile universe. And there are few universes as large and hostile as Warhammer 40K. That's why I was so delighted that Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader puts you into the shiny, step-on-me boots of a titular Rogue Trader, the heir to the von Valancius dynasty and a very powerful member of the high nobility in the Imperium. Getting to roleplay someone of such status and wealth across more than 130 hours of gritty, tactical combat and superb quest writing is a fresh power fantasy for this setting and this genre. I just wish it wasn't plagued by more annoying bugs than there are daemons in the Warp.\n\nRogue Trader is an absolutely colossal, somewhat lumbering CRPG. And like my grandiose, gothic voidship the Fortunatrix, it's not exactly polished to a mirror sheen. On the bright side, like Baldur's Gate 3 before it, almost none among the huge catalog of side quests and optional activities feel like filler. Developer Owlcat's previous games, Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous, had a lot of trash fights that honestly seemed like they were there to waste my time, but every encounter in Rogue Trader\u2019s epic-length campaign presents tactical challenges that are made interesting through new ways of thinking about its enemies and use of space and cover. And Rogue Trader has a lot of surprises in store for 40K fans in terms of the kinds of foes we get to fight.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Screenshots 17 Images\n\nBreaking away from the Pathfinder rule system Owlcat reproduced with almost self-defeating fidelity in its past two games, Rogue Trader pays homage to some of the classic Fantasy Flight Warhammer 40K tabletop RPGs, but this is really a new system built from the ground up. And that intentionality has allowed it to simply work better in most cases. I will warn you that it is still a very crunchy system, though. If you're coming here straight from Baldur's Gate 3, Larian's interpretation of D&D will seem like a soft, gooey nougat that melts in your mouth by comparison.\n\nAbility descriptions in Rogue Trader can feel like reading an academic paper on differential equations, and the wordy, overly-detailed way the tooltips are presented doesn't do it any favors. I eventually got a handle on it and came to enjoy the depth it offers, but it's intimidating until you learn its visual language. And it never stops being kind of a research project to understand what a new talent actually does on first inspection.\n\n\u201c Rogue Trader pays homage to the tabletop, but this is a new system.\n\nThe upshot of having so many options is that the power of my squad fully outstripped the default difficulty by around halfway through the campaign. My heavy weapons specialist Argenta, like a broken ramp deck in Magic: The Gathering, can do what functionally amounts to infinity damage on Normal by the third or fourth round of combat, trivializing even some of the toughest bosses I faced. Luckily, difficulty in Rogue Trader is fully modular and can be changed at any time. You can keep out-of-combat skill checks at Normal but really crank up combat difficulty in targeted and granular ways, which allowed me to dial in a satisfying experience \u2013 though it does take some patience and experimentation. And there are some startling difficulty spikes here and there where I had to nudge things back down temporarily.\n\nHow are you going to play your Rogue Trader? Dogmatic - I do everything by the book, as The Emperor commands. Heretical - I serve the Ruinous Powers of Chaos and love hurting people. Iconoclast - This galaxy is messed up but that doesn't mean I have to be. Pragmatic - Whatever makes the most sense in the moment. I don't live by a code. Answer See Results\n\nOne of my favorite elements of this combat system is how powerful support characters can be. I made my Rogue Trader, the esteemed Katarin von Valancius, an officer who not only hands out buffs, but can also give allies free actions. This ended up making me the lynchpin of the entire party even though I rarely ever fired a shot or swung a chainsword myself. That\u2019s why I have Yrliet, an ancient elven ranger with a sniper rifle, Argenta, a warrior space nun, and Ulfar, a freaking werewolf in power armor, after all. I'm never going to be as cool as any of them, so helping them do violence even better is a great niche to find myself in. Setting up a combo where Ulfar cuts several people in half or Yrliet one-taps the enemy commander from across the map is endlessly satisfying.\n\nThe highly positional space combat is well done too, and plays out much like a naval engagement with lots of maneuvering and lining up broadsides. And a fairly involved colony management system reinforces the idea that I am a powerful ruler within this sector, even though some colony of the stats, like Security, didn't seem to matter much.\n\n\u201c The writing is what really steers the ship here.\n\nThe writing is what really steers the ship here, though. From the central quest to reclaim your protectorate and deal with a powerful Chaos cult, to terrifying encounters on desolate shipwrecks hidden away in the dark corners of the Koronus Expanse, to conversations with your diverse and multifaceted crew, the dialogue and scenario design is of a similar quality to Baldur's Gate 3 and other greats of the genre. Plus, if I had to pick three favorite factions in the 40K universe, they would be the Sisters of Battle, the Craftworld Eldar, and the Space Wolves. The fact that all three of those are represented by Rogue Trader's recruitable companions probably wasn't done specifically to pander to me, but it sure feels like it was.\n\nThe galaxy of Rogue Trader also looks great, from the cramped corridors of an imperial bunker to the wild expanse of an untamed jungle world. It manages to capture the harshness and moodiness of 40K without being constantly gloomy or depressing. There's a lot of deft use of color in every environment and on every model or portrait. Exploration is a treat, even if danger is usually just around the corner. The character designs rule, too, even if they definitely seem a bit dated for 2023 in terms of fine detail.\n\nRogue Trader\u2019s music is generally strong, and fits the tone of the 40K universe perfectly with its ominous chanting and pseudo-medieval gloominess. The problem is, Owlcat still hasn't really figured out how to use music dynamically to amp up a scene. A lot of huge, impactful moments deflate like a balloon because they're lacking the wicked or triumphant audio stings that would help them land so much harder. Beyond that, the sound design is top-tier, from the satisfying rapport of a bolter to the high-quality voice acting \u2013 what little there is of it.\n\nUnfortunately, Rogue Trade is packed with bugs \u2013 enough to stuff a Space Hulk with. I saw way too many missing tooltips, abilities that don't work correctly, T-posing servitors, and even a couple cases where my progress was blocked on a crucial quest and I had to wait for a workaround or a patch to continue. There have been several since I started playing the review copy, and to be fair the devs did caution me that continuing on a save from an older version could cause issues. So some of the stuff I experienced could be due to that. It's hard to say. Especially since the 1.0.1 patch released on December 14, I have gone back and found that most of the egregious stuff seems to be fixed and what's left mostly falls under funny and/or just annoying. But it might be worth giving this one a little more time in the plasma oven before jumping in."

        "text": "Look, I don\u2019t need to tell you how great Resident Evil 4 is. You\u2019ve either already played the original 15 times by now in any number of its various re-releases over the years, or were delighted to experience it for the first time with the phenomenal remake earlier this year (which IGN awarded our highest recommendation ). There was even a VR port of the original that came out just two years ago. But now, on top of it all, there\u2019s a PlayStation VR 2-exclusive VR mode for Resident Evil 4 Remake, raising the question of whether it\u2019s worth going back for yet another run through this horror classic from a different perspective. The answer may not at all surprise you! Yes, as it turns out: if you take an amazing horror game and give it a similar VR treatment to that of fellow residences of evil Biohazard and Village, it\u2019s still amazing (and often even more chilling) in true first-person. But it\u2019s also an imperfect port, with some finicky controls and tons of jarring cuts into third-person since, equally unsurprisingly, a remake of a game that first came out 17 years ago pretty clearly wasn\u2019t designed with virtual reality in mind.\n\nWhat we said about Resident Evil 4 Remake (not in VR) Loading Play Whether you're a fan of the original or a newcomer with a hankering for some action-heavy horror of the highest quality, Resident Evil 4 is like a parasite-riddled Spaniard: a total no-brainer. Its combat is friction-free but no less stress-inducing thanks to its ferocious cast of creatures, its story rapidly shuttles through a series of action scenes that are diverse in structure but uniformly unwavering in intensity, and its world is rich in detail and full of fun and often snarling surprises. Its improvements over the original are too numerous to list, from simple quality of life changes to completely overhauled boss fight mechanics, and with the exception of the disappointingly diminished personality of the merchant, the team at Capcom has barely put a foot wrong. Whaddaya buying? Only the most relentlessly exciting Resident Evil adventure of all time that\u2019s been rebuilt, refined, and realised to the full limits of its enormous potential. A wise choice, mate. - Tristan Ogilvie, March 17, 2023 Score: 10 Read the full Resident Evil 4 Review.\n\nJust about everything you know and love about Resident Evil 4 Remake is also true of its VR Mode, so seriously, if you haven\u2019t seen our Resident Evil 4 review or don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, go read that first just above. Just like playing on a flat screen, you\u2019ll get attacked by pitchfork wielding mobs in farms covered in sickly livestock and deeply troubled dogs, dodge fiery shrapnel fired from catapults manned by medieval cultists, go on the world\u2019s worst fishing trip, and buy guns from the only British person allowed to own firearms, and all of that is every bit as awesome, but VR seriously ups the horror and immersion. It felt great to be able to stare down the barrel of weapons I\u2019ve been familiarizing myself with since the days of my youth and tell the President\u2019s life-sized daughter to shut up and get behind me. Plus, being surprised by a zombie that pops up behind you without warning is especially horrifying when they\u2019re right up in your face, rendered in the beautiful high-definition goriness that is Resident Evil 4 Remake. The haptic feedback on the controllers and headset also add an extra tactile touch whenever you fire a weapon or get rocked by a nearby explosion.\n\n\u201c By contrast, first-person made RE7 and Village much more VR-friendly.\n\nThat said, Resident Evil 4 Remake obviously wasn\u2019t originally intended to be played as a first-person shooter, much less in VR, and that\u2019s very apparent every time you climb a ladder, step in a bear trap, dodge an enemy attack, or roundhouse kick some unlucky brainwashed peasant because you\u2019re jarringly swapped into third-person for a short out-of-body experience before getting thrown back into first-person again. By contrast, the VR modes for Resident Evil Biohazard and Village are both much more VR-friendly because they were designed to be played from first-person. It certainly detracts from the immersion when you\u2019re suddenly watching some other guy lie on the ground after taking a hit and have to stand there waiting for that dude to get back on his feet so you can continue playing.\n\nAre you going to play Resident Evil 4 again in VR? Yes! Yes, but it will be my first time No, I don't like VR/am not interested No, I don't have a PS VR2 Answer See Results\n\nAnd instead of engaging with the world around you in VR, like clicking an elevator button with your finger or sliding open a latch on a locked door, you just click a button prompt and watch it happen in front of you. Compared to Biohazard and Village, where you actually get to manipulate the world more intimately by doing things like putting a key into a keyhole and turning it in your hands, Resident Evil 4\u2019s VR mode is significantly less interactive. Even when you go to finish off an enemy on the ground or sneak up on them for a stealth takedown, you enter a weird view where you can see part of Leon\u2019s head, and that doesn\u2019t quite feel right. Since all the cutscenes are done in third-person too, they just stick you in a black void with a giant screen in it to watch the story play out like you\u2019re in the Sunken Place. I don\u2019t know that there was ever going to be a good solution to these issues due to the fundamental differences between what Resident Evil 4 is and what a great made-for-VR game entails, but it\u2019s definitely reminiscent of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.\n\n\u201c The Resident Evil VR formula is still extremely good in most regards.\n\nThe good news is that, wonky perspective issues aside, everything else follows the same Resident Evil VR formula, which is extremely good in most regards. Reaching for weapons on your belt and back before unloading them at the parasitic life forms in front of you, running away from a giant troll that\u2019s about to stomp you flat, and sneaking around to eliminate enemies from stealth all feel awesome. I even finally got to feel like I had good aim without the aid of a laser sight thanks to the effectiveness of first-person iron sights that just isn\u2019t reliable over the shoulder. And for those in need of special comfort accommodations, a variety of options are available to reduce your chances of experiencing motion sickness, like tunneling and snap turning, which are always appreciated.\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake VR Mode Gameplay Screenshots 53 Images\n\nThere is a bit of wonkiness with combat in VR, though. For example, you might make the horrible mistake of accidentally throwing a grenade at your feet when you meant to grab your knife, both of which are positioned on your chest right next to one another. Or when using a weapon with a scope on it, you\u2019ll have to hope the automatic detection that determines which eyeball the scope is held up to selects your preferred one, otherwise you\u2019ll find yourself struggling to reposition the weapon on your face so you can aim properly. Most of these are minor issues that mostly take some getting used to before you git gud, like how reloading can take significantly longer in VR early on when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, making you feel like a hilariously underqualified special agent. But once you get your feet wet with it, the payoff of feeling like an actual zombie-slaying superhero is well worth that learning curve.\n\nAlso, owing to the impressive specs of the PSVR 2 and the attached PlayStation 5, Resident Evil 4 is one of the best-looking VR games I\u2019ve ever played, and it\u2019s especially impressive when compared to the next-best option of playing the non-remake VR version that looks downright butt-ugly from start to finish. Similarly, the fantastic audio design in the base game is enhanced in the VR experience because now you can hear zombies chanting in the next room and tremble before the terrible roars of giant bosses. That high quality is hardly surprising given how great the regular game sounds and looks, but it just hits different in VR, and that novelty is absolutely worth strapping a screen to your face for at least a couple hours."

        "text": "When I reviewed Granblue Fantasy Versus back in February of 2020, I said it stood out as a great fundamentals-driven and uniquely approachable anime fighter that was held back by just a few key issues: An overly convoluted and dull RPG mode, only 11 playable characters, and dated delay-based netcode. I don\u2019t know if the developers used that as a checklist for things to improve in Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, but they may as well have because I\u2019m thrilled to see that they\u2019ve corrected all of those issues, and then some.\n\nLet\u2019s run down the new stuff and improvements: The newly renamed Story Mode is now a much brisker version of the base game\u2019s campaign that trims all of the fat and while also adding a new chapter; the fighting system has been completely overhauled for the better, adding several exciting new mechanics; there\u2019s better learning tools; rollback netcode; and even a Granblue-themed Fall Guys-esque mode included in the online lobby. It all amounts to one of the most feature-packed \u201cdefinitive edition\u201d-style updates to a fighting game I\u2019ve ever seen, and is a fantastic re-entry point into the grand world of Granblue Fantasy Versus.\n\nGranblue Fantasy Versus: Rising Review Screenshots 109 Images\n\nI\u2019m not going to go in depth on every single mechanical change made to the core fighting of Rising \u2013 because there are quite a lot \u2013 but the biggest ones are the removal of universal techniques added after launch like Overdrive and Tactical Move, a brand-new variation of special moves called Ultimate Skills, a resource called Bravery Points, and then a handful of powerful abilities that use those Bravery Points.\n\n\u201c Ultimate Skills add a ton of utility to every character, which stacks another layer onto the meter management game.\n\nI personally didn\u2019t keep up with Granblue when Overdrive and Tactical Move were added, so I can\u2019t quite comment on how their absence feels, but I can say that the new additions all feel great. Ultimate Skills are new variations of special moves that add all sorts of powerful new properties to existing moves at the cost of 50% of your special meter, with 25% getting refunded if the skill hits. As an example, the Ultimate version of Katalina\u2019s Frozen Blade shoots out a massive blade from full-screen distance that goes through most projectiles and can crumple the opponent and allow her to get a combo if she\u2019s positioned well enough, forcing you to think twice before throwing a projectile at her when she\u2019s got 50 meter. Other characters, like Siegfried, can use the ultimate version of his down special to just straight up carry his opponent from one end of the stage to the other. In addition to that, these moves can also uniquely be used even while on cooldown. It\u2019s just a ton of utility added to every character; there\u2019s a lot of freedom to create new combo routes depending on whether you want big damage, a hard knockdown, or added corner carry; and stacks another layer onto the meter management game, which improves the thoughtful decision making that\u2019s central to any great fighting game.\n\nWhat We Said About Granblue Fantasy Versus Loading Play Following in the footsteps of BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is one of Arc System Works\u2019 most approachable fighting games yet. It smartly balances considerations for more casual fighting game players without ever stepping on the toes of its hardcore audience. The result is a more grounded and neutral-heavy ArcSys alternative with all of the usual ArcSys flair, which is a fantastic breath of fresh air. Its RPG mode is dull, and its 11 character roster feels way too light, but all things considered, Granblue Fantasy: Versus feels like it could be the start of another special 2D fighting franchise. - Mitchell Saltzman. February 11, 2020.\n\nScore: 9 Read our full Granblue Fantasy Versus Review\n\nLoading Play\n\nBravery Points, meanwhile, are a resource that\u2019s tied specifically to two new abilities: Raging Strikes and Brave Counters. Brave Counters are simple: You press two buttons simultaneously while blocking to push an opponent off of you at the cost of one BP. Raging Strikes, however, are massively powerful attacks that can be used during a blockstring to crush an opponent\u2019s guard if they just sit there blocking. That allows you to follow up with a Raging Chain attack, which in turn enables you to convert that hit into a full combo, even though the opponent blocked the attack. Not only that, but Raging Strike can also be used to continue combos off of far-reaching attacks that wouldn\u2019t typically be comboable.\n\nOn paper, that may sound busted, but Raging Strikes are very smartly balanced, much like Drive Impacts are in Street Fighter 6. For one, they\u2019re super slow, and if they\u2019re being used predictably you can either just interrupt them with a jab or use a spot dodge that causes a cool looking slowdown effect, giving you plenty of time to do a big punish. The other important wrinkle in all of this is that Bravery Points also dramatically increase your defense if you bank them, so every point you spend means you\u2019ll take more damage from your enemy going forward. So you really have to make sure that you\u2019re using those points to seal out rounds as opposed to using them haphazardly.\n\nSky Scrappers\n\nPretty much everything else is what I remember from playing Granblue back in 2020. Which is to say, it\u2019s a uniquely beginner-friendly fighting game thanks to features like auto combos, easy one-button special move inputs (which also no longer incur added skill-cooldown penalties), and a very measured pace to the action that\u2019s far more akin to Street Fighter than most other ArcSys anime games. What is new for me, as someone who only played Granblue at launch, is the vast majority of the roster: it\u2019s shot up from a paltry 11 to a very respectable cast of 28 thanks to Rising including all of the DLC over the last three years, plus four entirely new characters.\n\nWhats your pick for best fighting game of the year? Street Fighter 6 Mortal Kombat 1 Nickelodeon All Star Brawl 2 Pocket Bravery Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising Other (Let us know in the comments) Answer See Results\n\nEven as someone who didn\u2019t play the mobile Gacha game and didn\u2019t watch much of the anime, the playable roster in Granblue is stellar. Every character is just bursting with personality, there\u2019s a great spread of different archetypes, the super moves are gorgeous, there are a ton of fun and unique intro exchanges between characters when a match begins, and the character designs themselves are just spectacular.\n\nThe four brand-new characters \u2013 Nier, Grimm, Anilla, and Siegfried \u2013 all live up to that standard as well. My personal favorite is Siegfried, who is a Dragon Knight infused with dragon blood, and fights with a giant sword that hits like a truck. He\u2019s also able to sacrifice some of his health for a power buff that increases his damage up to three times, boosting his already-insane damage output even higher. Both Nier and Grimmnir are pretty technical characters, with Nier being a puppet character that relies on the position of both herself and her puppet, and Grimmnir being an extremely mobile character who can place down sigils that he can dash through, making for some absolutely wild and flashy-looking combos and set ups.\n\nRounding out the newcomers is Anilla, who is much more straightforward, but still packs her own uniquely quirky charm by fighting with a spear that\u2019s bigger than she is, along with an army of sheep that she sends careening into her opponents. She\u2019s adorable.\n\nThe new characters are at the forefront of Rising\u2019s new Story Mode chapter, which thankfully removes all of the extraneous RPG systems, weapon collecting, and so on. Instead, now you just earn skills that you can equip to your character for some sort of temporary boost or buff. Not that I ever really needed it \u2013 it\u2019s still ridiculously easy \u2013 with even the late-game bosses barely putting up any sort of fight.\n\n\u201c Ultimately, Story Mode is an improvement over GBFV's RPG Mode, but mostly because its much faster and less arduous to get through it.\n\nThe fighting is secondary to the story though, and as far as the story goes, it\u2019s\u2026 fine. There are definitely some funny moments, mostly involving the Lowain trio, but the overarching plot is largely uninteresting and didn\u2019t quite have that big satisfying payoff that I was hoping for, given the buildup to the final few chapters. Ultimately, it\u2019s an improvement over the vanilla GBFV\u2019s RPG Mode, but mostly just because it\u2019s much faster and less arduous to get through it. It took me just about two or three hours to beat the new chapter, which felt like the exact amount of time I wanted to spend with it. .\n\nRising to the Top\n\nRising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus as well. Its training mode and learning tools are all far more fully featured, with a more detailed frame data display; quick character guides that give you an overview of what a character excels at and what buttons you should press at different ranges; and practical combo trials that give you combos for every situation, from anti-airs to counter-hit anti-airs, corners, and combos for when you hit your opponent with a raging strike. I never felt like I needed to search elsewhere to get a baseline level of competency with a new character, which is how a modern fighting game should be.\n\n\u201c Rising improves just about every other area of Granblue Fantasy Versus.\n\nThe charming chibi avatar lobby system also returns from the base game, though this time it\u2019s been greatly expanded to be an actual virtual social hub where you can play soccer, go to the arcade and play a crane game for collectibles, queue up for ranked and casual matchmaking, or park next to one of the seemingly hundreds of arcade cabinets to play with other people in the lobby. It\u2019s not quite as impressive as Street Fighter 6\u2019s Battle Hub, and the performance is a little chuggy once you enter, but it\u2019s still a fun way to meet new players and experience online play in a way that goes beyond just endlessly queuing for matches. Of course, if that is what you want to do, you can still do that too. You don\u2019t have to engage in the lobby at all if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nThe best thing, though, is the addition of rollback netcode, which at this point should virtually be a requirement for fighting games going forward. Online play feels as smooth as can be, on par with bar-setters like Street Fighter 6, Guilty Gear Strive, and Killer Instinct.\n\nLoading Play\n\nThen there\u2019s Grand Bruise, which is \u2013 as crazy as it sounds \u2013 a Fall Guys-inspired game within a game that uses the lobby\u2019s chibi anime avatars in a platforming battle royale mode. And you know what? It\u2019s pretty fun! It combines Mario Kart-style item pickups with frantic platforming footraces, resulting in an absolutely chaotic mode that had me shouting and hollering in exactly the same ways that Fall Guys does. It\u2019s very obvious that Bruise is not meant to be a main attraction \u2013 there\u2019s no ability to create a custom lobby, there\u2019s only a paltry number of minigames to play right now, and some of those, like a wave based survival minigame, go on for a bit too long. Still, it\u2019s a fun diversion, and is especially a nice addition for those who opt for the free version of Rising, which includes Grand Bruise and a rotating selection of three playable characters, plus Gran."

        "text": "You have to hand it to Cherry \u2013 she is tough. From the moment you meet, and she's dragging what's left of her beaten, broken android body across the ground in vengeful pursuit of the guy who ran off with her girl, everything about who Cherry is \u2013 strong, sassy, principled, and gloriously self-aware \u2013 becomes instantly clear. Not only does it nicely set the stage for one of 2023's more unforgettable video game heroes, it leaves you with no doubt what metroidvania Cookie Cutter is all about.\n\nIt's about violence. The gorier and the bloodier the better.\n\nUnlike other recent games pressed from the same mold, though, Cookie Cutter isn't about innovating the metroidvania template or incorporating ideas inspired by other genres, such as Hollow Knight's soulslike influences. As old-school a metroidvania as it comes, Cookie Cutter blends a memorable cast with a sprawling, interconnected world and striking hand-drawn graphics. And although it does occasionally frustrate as much as it entertains, it's nonetheless one of the more approachable entries to the genre. If you like blood, of course. Lots and lots of blood.\n\nCookie Cutter Gameplay Screenshots 71 Images\n\nI've spent a lot of time with metroidvanias over the last few years, and as most have been grim, gothic, oh-so-serious affairs, Cookie Cutter's unabashed, over-the-top presentation and celebration of color are refreshing. I also cared about Cherry and her quest, and was intrigued by the way she's able to augment herself to adapt to the challenges of The Megastructure you\u2019ll explore with her. Accompanied by her friend Regina \u2013 a disembodied robotic head that closely resembles the part of the female anatomy that rhymes with her name (yes, really) \u2013 Cherry lets her fists do the talking as she punches, smacks, and flattens anything stupid enough to get in her way.\n\nCookie Cutter's world is rich in detail, and each biome of the map is home to a unique selection of critters \u2013 say, the Denzel Factory's droids, or the Bloody Den's maddeningly electrified eel things. You\u2019ll attack them with a combination of light and hard attacks \u2013 the former builds up VOID power; the latter uses it up \u2013 and there are countless combos to perfect as you kick and punch your way through the world. One-on-one, most enemies aren't too difficult to defeat, but even if you're better than me at parrying (which wouldn't be difficult), very easy enemies can be overwhelming if there are enough of them.\n\n\u201c The over-the-top presentation and celebration of color are refreshing.\n\nHow you play will change over time, though, particularly as you unlock new abilities and find components that help you tweak Cherry's skillset to better suit your playstyle, such as focussing on offensive skills or making it quicker to self-heal. But it doesn't matter how bombastic the animations are when Cherry wipes out a boss with a motorbike or beats something to death with an electric guitar \u2013 sometimes, you'll just never feel quite powerful enough to take on the sheer number of enemies around you (especially the ones that can shoot through walls).\n\nBecause it takes a while for you to unlock Cherry\u2019s full potential, the first half of Cookie Cutter\u2019s 20-ish hour run-time has a couple of surprisingly challenging boss fights, as well as some particularly difficult horde-like auto-lock rooms where you have to take on waves of increasingly tougher enemies to continue. Part of the appeal of a metroidvania is that whenever you accidentally stumble into a boss lair and get your face kicked in, you can make a swift exit, find some upgrades or secrets along other paths, and then come back buffed up and ready for a fight. But although Cookie Cutter ostensibly offers a nonlinear approach, on a couple of occasions, I discovered that the next thing I needed to level up was just past the enemies in that room, which meant I had to tackle them in order to progress the story, which can be frustratingly limiting.\n\nDo metroidvanias also have to have \"soulslike\" elements? No, I dislike metroidvanias with soulslike stuff It's not mandatory, but it can be fun Yes, it's an important part of why I like the genre I don't care either way Answer See Results\n\nAnd yes, there are secrets for those prepared to seek them out. In true metroidvania style, there are plenty of hidden materials, weapons, and abilities for Cherry to find if you're the curious sort who always has to punch a wall before you leave just in case it's breakable. Sometimes your curiosity will be rewarded. Sometimes it will not. The glee of discovering a secret, off-the-map room never gets old, though.\n\nThe best part about Cookie Cutter is how it constantly reinvents itself. Just as you start to feel a little tired of bashing things with your fists, you'll unlock a guitar that you can smash on enemy heads. And as soon as you think you've exhausted every cave and corridor, you'll unlock a new ability that will let you ground stomp, or quick dash, or grapple, which opens up previously inaccessible areas. You'll learn how to whack not only interactive objects around the map \u2013 say, giant spheres which act as locks \u2013 but also enemies to send them flying into environmental hazards, too, so the electrified floors and steam vents that made getting around for Cherry so difficult can now be used to her advantage.\n\n\u201c Sometimes Cherry can get lost in a cloud of fists and blood.\n\nThat said, it can get a little tricky to see what's going on, especially as the camera occasionally zooms out when I'd prefer it was closer and vice versa, with no way to change it manually. This is particularly frustrating when you're locked in a room with dozens of enemies and can't quite see where you are, let alone where you're going, causing me to sometimes lose sight of Cherry completely in a cloud of fists and blood and dismembered body parts.\n\nThankfully, she moves around quite well. Despite the frenzied action, Cherry is responsive, moving with purpose and fluidity as she fights, and you'll unlock enough save points that death rarely feels overly punishing (apart from a couple of cruelly distant checkpoints before boss rooms). Fast traveling is tougher but not agonisingly so, as each area of the map only has one or two Denzel Stations with teleporters that let you nope out of an area completely. Energy Cells, the collectible slots Cherry uses to equip passive buffs, are at least in plentiful supply, letting you extend your health bar, improve your \"ass-kicking,\" or add an additional uppercut during a multi-hit combo.\n\nThe main issue, really, is Cherry's self-healing ability. Her offensive skills use VOID power, which you build up by landing light attacks, but you can also use this power to self-heal simply by hitting down on the D-pad. Let there be no doubt \u2013 I am very, very grateful it exists, and suspect my experience would've been a more frustrating one without it. However, it takes so long for Cherry to pull it off \u2013 once again, especially in high-octane rooms where you're locked in and the enemies just keep on spawning. You're eventually able to upgrade it to be a bit faster, but it makes the early hours just that much more challenging.\n\nAnd if you do find Cookie Cutter too tough, there's nothing you can do about that, either. Although it's undoubtedly one of the easier Metroidvanias I've enjoyed, it has almost no customizable options beyond key rebinding, and no ability to tweak the difficulty \u2013 be that to make it harder or easier \u2013 to better suit your skill level."

        "text": "Why are so many people finding satisfaction in simulation games about manual labor? Farming, building, power washing - there\u2019s some deep psychological study to be done on creating the illusion of productivity, but I couldn\u2019t care less. All I know is that if I can\u2019t make sure this garage extension has perfect ebony paneling, I will have brought shame to the good name of my ancestors. House Flipper 2 has reawakened my dormant obsession with wallpaper and trash collection, building on the success of the first cult game with a new coat of paint and some noticeable gameplay improvements.\n\nLike in the original House Flipper, you spend your time in House Flipper 2 renovating houses, which involves everything from cleaning to demolition to picking out new furniture. There are requests from characters that you can fulfill and houses you can buy, fix up, and sell for a profit. The changes to the meat and potatoes of House Flipper are minimal \u2013 a quality-of-life addition here, and an extra mode like Sandbox there \u2013 which feels like the right balance for fans of a slice-of-life sim like this. If you\u2019re someone who spent hours perfecting their tiling techniques or real estate profit strategies, the last thing you want is to grab a sequel and find yourself in unfamiliar territory. Just the same way you don\u2019t want to buy the new Sims game and find out you have to solve a sudoku puzzle when you want them to woohoo and you have to do their taxes now.\n\nHouse Flipper 2 Screens 12 Images\n\nAnd thus the campaign is back, and it\u2019s a similar story mode that serves as a breezy ride through the various tools and tasks. It\u2019s a good refresher for the veteran foreman, and a solid education for the new kids. The missions arrive by email and vary in their brief: a new room for a baby; renovating a flood-damaged designer home; turning a dilapidated cabin with real \u201cand they could only identify the body with dental records\u201d vibes into a movie set. I\u2019m not talking about Alan Wake 2 levels of plot detail here, but you can only take so much literary gymnastics on the weekend. It\u2019s less about giving you some sort of emotional moment through the power of wardrobe placement, and more about delivering some sense of progression to the soothing repetition of clean, paint, fix, and furnish.\n\n\u201c If you want to just keep hitting \u201cbuy\u201d and piling that stuff up in the corner to complete a room, that\u2019s between you and your god.\n\nTo work your magic there\u2019s a radial menu of tools from cleaning to demolition, a store where you buy materials like wallpaper, furniture, and plants, all equipping you to go through the house ticking off tasks in each room. It keeps track of what you need to paint, what furniture needs to go in that room, and house many stains are left to scrub, but it\u2019s a gentle master. It might tell you how many chairs and lamps a room needs, and what kind, but it\u2019s not marking you on your feng shui or anything. If you want to just keep hitting \u201cbuy\u201d and piling that stuff up in the corner to complete a room, that\u2019s between you and your god.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite virtual chore? Cleaning Cooking Fixing broken items Farming Building Other - tell us in the comments Answer See Results\n\nThe same goes for painting and wallpapering \u2013 it needs you to hit a certain amount on a certain wall, but should you get reckless and freehand the paint roller over the wrong area, feel free to start whistling in a jolly fashion and backing gently away. As a little pat on the back, you earn perks as you use each skill. They sound small, such as being able to get more paint on a roller or faster cleaning, but when you\u2019re restoring a desolate villa you\u2019ll be really happy you earned them. If you\u2019re trying to speed-run a level you can complete a job with just one star, and move on to the next story quest. Like the original, House Flipper 2 only penalizes you in the payout you get, so don't worry about getting in-game calls from teary old grannies who want to know why you sold her toilet and then downed tools.\n\n\u201c Don't worry about getting in-game calls from teary old grannies who want to know why you sold her toilet and then downed tools.\n\nOne tool on the radial menu did remain a mystery to me through the story quests, and I've yet to need it in any of the fixer-uppers I've bought at auction. It\u2019s a wiring tool that lets you link sockets and appliances throughout the house, but I can\u2019t make heads or tails of it. Either it's designed for more serious builders who live in sandbox mode, or every house I've worked on and sold to families is an electrical death trap. (Or perhaps both.) And people think this type of game offers no adrenaline rushes!\n\nA minor change that pays off in House Flipper 2 is the new visual style, a big step up from the basic, \u201cHaven\u2019t I seen that exact same chair in 12 other indie games?\u201d look of the past. It's one of the stranger quirks of this type of simulation game, whether you're clearing out old barns or renovating a train station, a lot of the objects start to look familiar. It comes from developers being able to buy pre-made game items from other companies, but in House Flipper 2 there's definitely an improvement with an in-game furniture store full of decor and oddities that make everything feel a little fresher.\n\nHowever, the biggest change that adds bang to the house price buck is the addition of House Flipper 2\u2019s sandbox mode, a chance to start a house from scratch instead of mopping up after a bunch of reprobates and then adhering to their questionable design choices. It\u2019s a nice addition, but after spending some time with it I found I didn\u2019t enjoy actually having to figure out whole floor plans as much as I did messing with ones that were already there. The community is going to build some crazy stuff with it, though, so I look forward to leaving it alone and lazily admiring the Palace of Versailles as rebuilt in House Flipper 2 by a 47-year-old woman from Iowa.\n\n\u201c The community is going to build some crazy stuff with sandbox mode.\n\nI should also mention the new Assembly Mode, which brings back an element that\u2019s been removed from the main game in House Flipper 2. In House Flipper: Origins (or whatever we\u2019re calling the first one now) every time you had to install a shower or a sink you could look forward to a slowly animated process of screwing and unscrewing various components; now you can just whack those things into a room without even thinking about a screwdriver. I can imagine a building purist feeling cheated, but I won't miss having to deal with urinal plumbing systems unless I want to. If I ever do, that laborious process is still available \u2013 just tucked away in this mode where you have the chance to install raw plugs and get rewarded with store discounts.\n\nLoading Play\n\nFor me, House Flipper 2 absolutely nails the flow state that makes this type of sim game such an all-encompassing way to spend your gaming time. The dopamine hits come in little waves, you\u2019d have to be trying very hard to fail, and the stakes are so low that worms tease them about their height. You can decide to get really pissed that some dude is trying to lowball you on your latest flipping project at auction, but that\u2019s an issue between you and your therapist, not something House Flipper 2 does anything to inflict on you.\n\nAfter finishing the story quests in around ten hours or so - you can do it in less if you're not obsessed about getting mugs on shelves in meticulous formation - I\u2019m working my way through the properties I can flip at auction, and with plenty of houses to cover with pink shag rugs and yellow zebra wallpaper, this will be on my regular gaming rotation whenever I need a break from murdering aggressive alien life or trying to have sex with bears. It\u2019s not the most exciting game out there, but they don\u2019t all have to be."
